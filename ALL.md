# Pointers for Accurate Corrections

You may need to consider the following aspects to ensure all necessary corrections.

**Content:** there may be some errors that make the answer a little different from the given topic. You need to correct such issues to make the essay coherent.

Sample:  

| Question | Do you prefer quality or price when shopping? |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Answer** | I prefer quantity to quality when shopping. |
| **Correction** | I prefer ~~quantity~~ price to quality when shopping. |

The use of “quantity” was not grammatically wrong, and the student may have thought about buying many things within a budget. However, the topic asks the student to choose between \[price\] and \[quality\], so writing about “quantity” is not relevant.

**Vocabulary:** there may be some wrong use of words. This is different from the “content” category because such errors are not dependent on the topic.

Sample:

| Question | How can we use drones to solve problems in Japan? |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Answer** | We can use drones to enquire old buildings. |
| **Correction** | We can use drones to ~~enquire~~ inspect old buildings. |

We cannot really ask questions to buildings (even if we do, buildings will probably not answer), so “enquire” does not make sense in this context and should be corrected.

**Grammar:** plain old grammatical errors should be corrected in accordance with context.

Sample:

| Question | Describe a place you have been to in 3 sentences. |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Answer** | I have been to Osaka last year. |
| **Correction** | I ~~have been~~ went to Osaka last year. |

“last year” indicates a clear time reference for the past, so the present perfect tense cannot be used in this case.

**Logic:** there may be grammatical changes you need to bring to make the whole essay coherent.

Sample:

| Question | How can you prevent global warming in your daily life? |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Answer** | I will stop using plastic bags. This also helps me save money. |
| **Correction** | I will stop using plastic bags. This will also help me save money. |

The student’s second sentence is not grammatically incorrect. However, as the student wrote “I will stop,” we can assume that the student hasn’t yet stopped using plastic bags but will do so in the future. Saving money is an effect of not using plastic bags, so this can only be possible after the student stops using plastic bags (a future action).

# Correcting words written in Japanese

Writing Japanese words is not wrong, especially when it is a piece of information about Japan. However, the words should be in English letters, not in Japanese letters. Also, the essays the students write are in English, and the meaning of all the words should be clearly understandable. 

For common Japanese words (words that are well-known), you don’t have to make any corrections; **you can suggest clarifying the meaning for non-Japanese readers in the comment**.

For uncommon words, **you should make necessary corrections to clarify the meaning and guide the student accordingly**. 

Find samples below – 

| Common Words |  |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  | **Type 1 (with context)** | **Type 2 (without context)** |
| Sample answer | I recommend tourists visit **Kinkakuji**. I think they will be impressed to see **this temple** covered in gold. It is one of the most famous sightseeing spots in Kyoto. It has a large pond, and the scenery is very beautiful. In fall, we can enjoy the autumn leaves. | I recommend tourists visit **Kiyomizudera**. I think they will be impressed by the beautiful view from the wooden stage. There are many cherry and maple trees near it, so the scenery in spring and fall is very beautiful. |
| Sample correction | *No correction necessary for the Japanese word* | *No correction necessary for the Japanese word* |
| Sample suggestion | *No suggestion is necessary because the context clarifies what Kinkakuji is.* | A foreign reader may not know what kind of place Kiyomizudera is. It’s better to write Kiyomizu Temple or Kiyomizudera Temple. |
| Uncommon Words |  |  |
|  | **Type 1 (Japanese words)** | **Type 2 (Japanese text)** |
| Sample answer | We should avoid poisute. | We should avoid ポイ捨て. |
| Sample correction | We should avoid poisute (littering). | We should avoid littering ~~ポイ捨て~~. |
| Sample suggestion | The word “poisute” is Japanese, and not many foreigners know about it. I suggest mentioning the English meaning. That way, your writing will be easy to understand for everyone. | I looked up the Japanese word online and found that it means ‘littering’. As you are writing an English essay, please try to use the English word. |

## Pointers for temple names:

Temple names are usually easy to find online. Thus, it’s not wrong for a student to write only *Ginkakuji* or only *Fushimi Inari Taisha*. However, from the perspective that the English essays should be easy to understand for all non-Japanese readers, it’s better to have some clarification for the names. As such, a student writing “*Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine*”/“*Fushimi Inari Shrine*” is okay — an experienced corrector may know that “ji” means temple and think that writing both “Taisha” and “Shrine” together is redundant, but another foreign reader may not. 

Thus, in the category of common words type 2, any of the following forms is acceptable:

| Kinkakuji/ Kinkaku-ji | Kinkaku Temple | Kinkakuji Temple |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Kiyomizudera/ Kiyomizu-dera | Kiyomizu Temple | Kiyomizudera Temple |
| Fushimi Inari Taisha | Fushimi Inari Shrine | Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine |
| Itsukushima Jinja | Itsukushima Shrine | Itsukushima Jinja Shrine |

Note: These are only some common names that appear in the students’ answers. There are many more temples and shrines. When you do need to make any corrections, please look up the names themselves to understand whether you should add “temple” or “shrine”.

# Correcting the essay structure

## Regarding Essay Format

An essay should have three distinct parts: introduction-body-conclusion.

All three essay parts are necessary for an **argumentative/opinionative essay** (where the students have to pick a side on a topic and defend/justify their view). The conclusion is *not mandatory* for **descriptive essays** (where the students don’t have to justify anything). 

Sometimes, the students don’t follow the proper structure for an essay. Usually, either the introduction or the conclusion is missing. We shared an instruction video in the Facebook group. [Here is the link](https://youtu.be/6PnsKg7hkIo); do check it out because if an essay is not properly structured, you need to add the necessary parts or at least suggest them in the comment.

Let us refer to ‘errors related to essay structures’ as “structural errors” or “structural issues”.

Here is a sample to illustrate the issue:

| Original answer |
| ----- |
| I believe, therefore, that people work for their hobby. Other reasons why people want to work for their family. This is because the family is very important. For example, if a person want to support their family such as father, mother, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, pet. They must work for their family. |

The problem in this essay is that the 1st sentence cannot be an introduction (there is nothing that can result in the inference). Cutting “therefore” can be a simple way to fix the introduction in this case.

The essay also lacks a proper conclusion. As this is a descriptive essay, the lack of a conclusion is not necessarily a structural error, but the student clearly needs some guidance regarding what can be an introduction and what can be a conclusion. A concluding remark that could be added (*or suggested in the comment*) is as follows:

Therefore, they must work for their family and hobbies.  
Or  
That is why I believe that hobbies and family motivate people to work.

*NB. The student didn’t elaborate on hobbies as a motivation, but that’s a **cohesion issue** and must be addressed in the comment.*

Here is a sample to illustrate the necessity of a clear introduction:

| Original answer |
| ----- |
| I watch an anime called white sound aquatop. It made me interest work at aquarium. In order to become watch YouTube videos. Also, I study about fish and the ocean. |

The problem with this essay is that there is no topic sentence to clearly introduce the topic. Reading the essay, you might think that it is about an inspiring anime (or any other artistic piece), but the student actually wrote this as an answer to this question (prompt): What job do you want to do in the future? 

From this, you should understand how an essay can completely misguide the reader if the topic is not clearly introduced. The topic should always be clearly introduced in the introduction part, generally in the first sentence, which is called the topic sentence. 

A relevant topic sentence that can be added to this essay is as follows:

I want to work at an aquarium.  
Or  
I want to become an aquarist.

## Regarding Introduction and Conclusion

Another case is that the introduction and the conclusion may be identical in the same essay. In such a case, you need to suggest an alternative in the comment.

* Here is a sample to illustrate that:

| Original answer |
| ----- |
| I think **it is more effective to study at night**. First, because my memorial power improves. It makes memorization subjects easier to remember. Second, because I can study for a long time. It allows me to study many subjects. That’s why **it is effective to study at night**. |

Here, you’ll notice that the first and the last sentences are grammatically correct*,* but some variation would improve the essay by reducing repetitiveness. Generally, the first sentence introduces the topic and the conclusion wraps up the essay after a thorough description and/or explanations; therefore, the conclusion should have something more to offer. In such cases, the teachers expect you to suggest alternatives in the comment.

Some alternatives for the last sentence that could be suggested in the comment for this essay:

That’s why I think studying at night is better.  
&  
That’s why studying at night is better for me.

* Here is another instance where the 1st and the last sentences are almost identical but are not grammatically correct:

| Original answer |
| ----- |
| **I prefer reading the news online reading it newspaper**. I have two reasons. First, I can read it anytime and I can read quickly it. Second I can get a lot of information there is a put of on the Internet. Therefore I think **I prefer reading the news online reading it newspaper**. |

The 1st and the last sentences are almost identical and contain the same grammatical errors. A simple correction for the original expression would be, 

 I prefer reading the news online to reading it in a newspaper.

However, bringing some variation would make the essay a lot better. Since both sentences require some corrections, this is a chance to show different ways of writing it through the correction itself.

Some possible alternative corrections for the conclusion are –  

Therefore, ~~I think~~ I prefer reading the news online ~~reading it newspaper~~.  
Or  
Therefore, I think ~~I prefer~~ reading the news online is better than reading it in the newspaper.

*NB. The first version requires fewer changes than the second one, so using the former for the correction and suggesting the latter in the comment would be a good combination.*

## Regarding the Topic Sentence

A good topic sentence is important for a good introduction. Even when the student does write a topic sentence, there may be two types of confusion.

1) Unclear topic sentences

Sometimes, the students write the topic sentence in reference to the question and don’t properly introduce the topic. 

| Question sample | Do you think that all universities in Japan should be free? |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Answer sample** | Yes, I think so. |

The answer sample is grammatically correct, but it doesn’t clearly introduce the topic. For SLC essays, the students are answering a question, so the readers can always refer to the question and understand the context from both the question and the rest of the essay. Therefore, correcting such topic sentences is *not necessary*. However, generally, a clear topic sentence is one that introduces the topic of the essay. You should suggest the student write a detailed opening to introduce the topic. This can be considered a writing tip.

| Answer sample | Yes, I think so. |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Correction sample** | Yes, I think so. |
| **Comment sample** | You can make the 1st sentence more detailed. A topic sentence should clearly introduce the essay’s topic so that the reader can understand the topic even without seeing the question. For example, you can write, “Yes, I think that all universities in Japan should be free.” |

2) Wording that doesn’t match the question’s suggestion

Sometimes, students write a clear topic sentence but don’t follow the exact one mentioned in the question or the correction criteria. If it is grammatically correct and also matches the context, it’s a functional introduction; you don’t have to correct it or point it out in the comment.

| Question sample | What is the most memorable present you have ever received? |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Model answer** | The most memorable present I have ever received is a watch. |
| **Student’s answer** | The skateboard my parents gave me is more memorable than all other presents I have received. |

*NB. If the students try to explore different phrasing and structures, it indicates that they are actively trying to improve their English skills, and we should help them do that\!*

**Summary for structural correction:**

| Structural Issue | Action to take |  |
| ----- | ----- | :---- |
| Lack of a proper intro+body+conclusion | Add the necessary part in the correction, or |  |
|  | Suggest necessary additions in the comment |  |
| Introduction (First sentence) \= Conclusion (Last sentence) | Doesn’t need correction | Suggest alternative expressions in the comment |
|  | Needs correction | Try to use different expressions in the correction |

# Necessary and Unnecessary Corrections

Based on the general guidelines for corrections, if you notice a scope for improvement, consider whether the correction would make any significant difference according to any of the abovementioned aspects. Below are some special cases.

1) Changing “which” to “that” in a restrictive clause: unnecessary \[refer to relevant study materials for details\]

Sample:

| Student’s writing | My most memorable present is a photo frame which my friends gave me. |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Correction** | My most memorable present is a photo frame **that** my friends gave me. |
| **Verdict** | Unnecessary |

2) Adding or removing the relative pronoun in a restrictive clause: a restrictive clause with a subject of its own may be written with or without the relative pronoun. That is called a reduced restrictive clause. Whichever the student writes is okay, and changing one for the other would be unnecessary.

Sample (1):

| Student’s writing | I am happy to receive an award testifies my contribution. |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Correction** | I am happy to receive an award **that** testifies my contribution. |
| **Verdict** | Necessary |

The relative clause doesn’t have a subject and is incomplete. The relative pronoun cannot be skipped in this case as it acts as the subject for the verb of the relative clause.

 Sample (2):

| Student’s writing | I liked the book that you recommended. |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Correction** | I liked the book you recommended. |
| **Verdict** | Unnecessary |

The correction is not grammatically wrong, but what the student wrote was also correct. 

Sample (3):

| Student’s writing | I liked the book you recommended. |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Correction** | I liked the book **that** you recommended. |
| **Verdict** | Unnecessary |

The correction is not grammatically wrong, but what the student wrote was also correct

## **Joining or adding sentences for three-sentence answers:**

If a student writes more or fewer than three sentences for a question that asks for three sentences only, you should try to address it through both the corrections and the comment. Follow the instructions and examples below:

| Case | Correction (if possible) | Comment | Sample |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **More than 3 sentences** | *Merge* existing sentences into 3 complete sentences | Point out the question's instruction | The question asked you to write 3 sentences, but you wrote *x* sentences. I joined some of your sentences to show you how you could follow the question's instructions and also include all the details. |
| **Fewer than 3 sentences** | *Add* extra sentence(s) | Point out the question's instruction | The question asked you to write 3 sentences, but you wrote only *x* sentences, so I added n more. Please remember to read the question carefully next time. |

## **Adding any transition sentence:**

If you need to add any extra sentence to an essay to make the whole essay logical, you may do it.

**Special case**

Adding “I have n reasons for this”: when students list reasons (“First…Second…” etc.), you may think that having a transition sentence after the introduction can make the essay have a better flow. However, when the question clearly specifies the number of reasons the student should include in the answer, that addition is not necessary.

| Question sample | Every university student in Japan should study abroad for at least one semester. Write your opinion about this with two reasons in about 50-70 words. |
| :---: | :---: |

***Note**: if the student adds such a transition sentence, you don’t have to cut it.* 

# **THE DOS AND DON’TS OF COMMENTS**

To support our students to enjoy studying English and enhance their skills, we need to provide educational yet interesting comments. This guide will help you learn how you can engage with the students and also help them improve their writing.

# COMPONENTS OF A COMMENT
Engaging remarks
Commenting on the content of the essay

Specific to the content of the essay at hand, not the topic in general
Helpful guidance
Explanations for corrections; suggestions for improvement

Clear explanations and suggestions to help the students
Encouraging remarks
Ending remarks to motivate the student

A conclusion for the comment

COMPONENTS: Sample

CONTENT
Your overall essay was very logical, and I particularly liked your second point. No student should have to be stressed about what to wear to school every day or feel inferior because of clothing. A school is a place for educating and developing oneself to make a better society, and no inequality should affect that goal. I am impressed with the way you structured your thoughts.

GRAMMAR
Note that we cannot start a sentence with “Because” to refer to something in the previous sentence. You have to either join the two sentences or start with “It is because”. Instead of repeating the word “Also”, you may use words like “In addition”, “Moreover”, and “Furthermore” to make the writing more natural.

ENCOURAGEMENT
You’re doing a great job and the errors are not all that serious. Keep up the practice, and your writing will become flawless very soon!

Note: Grammatical explanations and writing tips/suggestions count as helpful guidance.

## COMPONENTS: Engaging Remarks

You should begin your comment with engaging remarks to interact with the student and make the student interested in reading the whole comment. This is your chance to appreciate the content of the essay and share your thoughts on it. 

✳️The engaging remarks should always be specific to each essay. They should never be generalized (something that can be written for different essays). ✳️

Below are good and bad comment samples for different answer samples:

| Sample 1 (short essay) |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Student’s answer (3-sentence essay) | I recommend Seirei no Moribito. It was written by Nahoko Uehashi. Please read it\! |
| Engaging remarks (1)  *Addresses unique points from the essa*y ✔ | This is my first time learning about Seirei no Moribito. I looked it up online and found that it was also made into an anime. The novel must be quite popular\! I hope your classmates also enjoy the novel.  |
| Engaging remarks (2)  *Can be written for most essays on the same topic* ❌ | That’s a great answer\! You have properly recommended your favorite novel and also mentioned the name of the author.  I hope your classmates also enjoy the novel.  |
| Sample 2 (regular essay) |  |
| Student’s answer | I personally believe convenience stores have a positive influence on Japanese society. First, we can buy something from a convenience store anytime because it is open 24 hours a day. Second, we can buy a wide range of products of consistent quality at convenience stores anytime, anywhere. There are various things such as food and stationery. For these reasons, I think that convenience stores have a good impact on our society. |
| Engaging remarks (1)  *Addresses unique points from the essa*y ✔ | Convenience stores are indeed necessary for Japanese society. People can go and buy things they need whenever they want from convenience stores since they are open around the clock. **A variety of goods can fulfill the needs of many people.** |
| Engaging remarks (2)  *Can be written for most essays on the same topic* ❌ | Convenience stores are indeed necessary for Japanese society. People can go and buy things they need whenever they want from convenience stores since they are open around the clock. **You are right that convenience stores have a positive influence and make lives easier.**  |

## COMPONENTS: Helpful Guidance

You may have to make a lot of corrections, but you don’t have to explain all of them in the comment. Pick some major ones that you can explain in a **clear and easy-to-understand** way. If the explanation is too complicated, the student may not understand it.

✳️ You should always point out *why* something is right or wrong \- focus on the reason \- not describe corrections in the comment. If the explanation gets complicated, you can instead suggest alternative expressions to show the student different possibilities. ✳️

Below are good and bad samples of explanations and suggestions as helpful guidance:

| Sample 1 |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Student’s answer excerpt | Japanese meals have various ingredients. I feel when I eat Japanese food. |
| Corrected excerpt | Japanese meals have various ingredients. I feel satisfied when I eat Japanese food. |
| Relevant guidance (1)  *Explains why the addition is necessary* ✔ | To clearly describe how you feel, you can write “I feel satisfied” or “I feel happy” in the nth sentence. |
|  | The sample shows the necessity of the addition and also provides an alternative suggestion. |
| Relevant guidance (2)  *Doesn’t explain the reason* ❌ | Instead of only “I feel”, you need to write “I feel satisfied” to complete the meaning\*. |
|  | \* “to complete the meaning” is not a clear reason because the student cannot understand why the student’s version was incomplete. |
| Sample 2  |  |
| Student’s answer excerpt | Parents should allow children use the internet freely. |
| Corrected excerpt | Parents should allow children to use the internet freely. |
| Relevant guidance (1)  *Explains why the addition is necessary* ✔ | It is correct to write “allow someone to do something”: adding “to” is necessary in this structure. That’s why I added “to” in your nth sentence.  |
|  | The sample shows the necessity of adding the preposition and also explains the general structure for future reference. |
| Relevant guidance (2)  *Doesn’t explain the reason* ❌ | There’s a missing preposition\* in your nth sentence, so I added “to”. |
|  | \* The student may not understand why that certain word is considered missing. It might mislead beginner students to think that a preposition must always be used in a sentence. |

**Special case:**  
Regarding Sample 2, telling the student that something was missing may be okay when the missing element is a vital part of the sentence structure (something that must always be there), for example, the subject of a verb. When you have enough space in the comment, you should, of course, try to provide detailed explanations.

| Sample 2.2 |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Student’s answer excerpt | Should allow children use the internet freely. |
| Corrected excerpt | Parents should allow children to use the internet freely. |
| Relevant guidance ✔ *Brief version*  | The subject is missing in your nth sentence, so I added “Parents”. |
| Relevant guidance ✔ *Detailed version*  | The nth sentence feels as if you are giving an order to the reader. However, parents are the ones who would allow their children to do something, so you need to write the subject (parents) clearly. |

### Prioritizing Helpful Guidance

When adding helpful guidance to your comment, prioritize errors that (1) you can explain easily,  and/or (2) errors that the student may not understand on his or her own. If the explanation seems complicated, try to share alternative suggestions instead. Everything should fit within the word limit. You might have to choose from various types \-

| Priority level | Types of explanations/suggestions |  |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **High** | Cohesion issues | Structural issues | Logical issues |
| **Medium** | Easy-to-explain grammatical errors1 | Suggestions for further improvement |  |
| **Low** | Difficult-to-explain grammatical errors2 | Minor errors: punctuation, capitalization, spelling  |  |

1 Errors that can be explained without using complicated grammatical terms *(tense, subject-verb agreement, conjunction usage, pronoun usage, singularity & plurality, etc.)*

2 Errors that have to be explained with complicated grammatical terms *(dangling modifier, parallelism, article, preposition, comma splice, adjective order, etc.)*

#### Sample

Think about the various types of errors in each essay and decide which to include in the comment.

| Student’s answer  |
| :---- |
| I disagree1 with having more security cameras in public places. First,it is useful for victims of crime and the police. 2By installing many security cameras,the possibility of victims or criminals being caught on camera will go up. So3, the police can research by4 the videos. Second,dengerous5 actions will be prevented. I think that more security cameras make6 public safety better. That is why I agree with having more security cameras in public places7. |

The essay has the following errors:

1. The topic sentence/introduction contradicting the rest of the essay  
2. Sentence structure and dangling modifier  
3. Coordinating conjunction at the start of a sentence  
4. Wrong preposition usage  
5. Spelling *(minor)*  
6. Tense (logical)  
7. Structural error: almost identical introduction and conclusion *\- no correction*   
8. Multiple spacing errors *(minor)*

Here, error 7 is a structural issue and it must be prioritized in the comment.  
Error 6 is something the student might not be able to understand alone: the sentence was grammatically okay, but for the flow of the essay, some logical correction is necessary.  
Other errors may also be included except for the minor ones (errors 5 & 8).  
Now let’s see 2 possible ways to write the comment. Different combinations would require different phrasing and presentation to avoid making the comment too long.

| Correction sample |
| :---- |
| I ~~dis~~agree with having more security cameras in public places. First, it is useful for victims of crime and the police. By installing many security cameras, we can increase the possibility of victims or criminals being caught on camera ~~will go up~~. ~~So~~ Thus, the police can research ~~by~~ the videos. Second, dangerous actions will be prevented. I think that more security cameras will make public safety better. That is why I agree with having more security cameras in public places. |
| Comment sample (1) \- 135 words |
| Thank you for sharing your opinion in such a nice way\! You are right that when we install more security cameras, criminals will know that they are being watched and feel reluctant to commit a crime. Even in the case of a crime, the police can have enough information for investigation. As you are discussing the possible effects of having more security cameras than now, you need to write what will happen after installing more security cameras. That’s why the future tense is suitable in the second-last sentence. The conclusion is very similar to the introduction. You can improve your essay by making them different. You could write the conclusion like this: “That is why I think we should put more security cameras in public places.” I really liked your answer. Keep writing. Good luck\! |
| Comment sample (2) \- 139 words |
| Thank you for sharing your opinion in such a nice way\! You are right that when we install more security cameras, criminals will know that they are being watched and feel reluctant to commit a crime. Even in the case of a crime, the police can have enough information for investigation. You mainly explained the necessity of more security cameras, so you actually agree with the idea. Thus, you should write “I agree” in your topic sentence. Also, avoid starting a sentence with coordinating conjunctions such as “so” in formal writing. You can use “Thus” or “Therefore” instead. By the way, you can improve your essay by making the topic and concluding sentences different. For example, “That is why I think we should put more security cameras in public places.” I really liked your answer. Keep writing. Good luck\! |

### Explaining Advanced Topics

Advanced topics are often difficult to explain, so we recommend focusing on other types of explanations and/or suggestions so that the helpful guidance is easy for students to understand. Only correction is enough for errors related to advanced topics that are difficult to explain.

If you can explain such topics in a simple way, you can do so for students whose apparent English proficiency is high. Try to avoid complicated grammatical terms.

Below is a sample with a common error in students’ writing: dangling modifier.

| Student’s answer excerpt | The government should build more cafeterias. By doing so, poor children will get to eat healthy food. |
| :---- | :---- |
| Corrected excerpt (1) *Keeping the modifier* | The government should build more cafeterias. By doing so, the government can ensure poor children will get to eat healthy food. |
| Corrected excerpt (2) *Changing the modifier* | The government should build more cafeterias. ~~By doing so~~ If the government does this, poor children will get to eat healthy food. |
| Possible explanation | Because of “by doing so”, the nth sentence gives the impression that poor children will do so (build more cafeterias). However, the government will do it, right? You should clearly mention “the government” as the subject to clarify that meaning. |

## COMPONENTS: Encouraging Remarks

End your comment by motivating the student to keep studying and practicing. Remember that our aim is to help the students learn more without being discouraged by mistakes. These can be simple remarks and don’t require special customization. The samples for various cases (attached below) contain various types of encouraging remarks. You can get ideas from those.

### Logical encouragement

In your attempt to encourage the students, please do not write illogical remarks like \-

“I enjoyed reading your essay and talking about it with you.” 

- you did not directly talk to the student;

“You’re doing better than before.”

- you cannot know if the student did better or worse than before as you cannot see a certain student’s past submissions;

“I look forward to hearing more from you”

- students are anonymous, so you can’t know even if you do get another essay from the same student

Examples of logical alternatives:

✅ I enjoyed reading your essay.  
✅ You are doing well.  
✅ I hope you continue writing more to improve your skills.

# Samples for Various Cases

## Cohesion Issues

Sometimes the essay is on topic but doesn’t fulfill **all the requirements** of the question. Such issues make the essay incohesive (let’s call them *cohesion issues* for simplicity) and must be pointed out in the comment. You should also share **suggestions regarding what could be included in the essay**. Such errors are of a higher priority than grammatical mistakes.

Below are some samples to illustrate the case.

| Sample 1 |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Question | People work because they need money to live. Apart from money, what are some other reasons why people work? |
| Answer sample  | In order to become the person I envision in the future, I want to contribute to society. ~~for~~ The first reason is that ~~because~~ I think it's great to work for people. The second reason is that I want to increase ~~what~~ the number of things I'm interested in. It is because l want to do what I'm interested in after gaining various experiences at work~~ing~~. |
|  | *The student wrote about his or her personal motivation rather than people in general. Also, the second reason doesn’t clarify the connection between working and finding new interests. The latter can be handled through corrections, but the former cannot be corrected easily.* |
| Comment sample (136 words) | I agree with you that we work to fulfill our roles in society. Every profession is necessary. Working also allows us to experience new things. You described your personal motivation for working with details. However, note that the question asked you to write about why people work, not only you. A simple way to fix this issue is to add a general introduction at the beginning. Then you could describe your reasons as examples: “Contributing to society and exploring different things are some reasons why people work. For example, I want to live as a responsible citizen by contributing to society through my work.” Also, start the last sentence with “It is because” or “This is because” to explain the previous sentence. If you keep these points in mind, you can write more logically. Keep practicing. |
| Sample 2 |  |
| Question | It is said that there is a lack of doctors in rural areas in Japan, even though there are plenty of them in most cities. What measures should the government take to solve this problem? |
| Answer sample  *\[The measures suggested by the student can be applied anywhere, not only in rural areas. For this topic, measures should be specific to rural areas.\]* | In order to solve the problem of a lack of doctors in rural areas in Japan, I think that the government should take some measures. This problem is caused by many factors. For example, the number of ~~retiring~~ doctors who retire early is increasing, and the burden per doctor is heavy. I can think of two measures. First, the government should distribute money to **rural** hospitals to prevent doctors from retiring. This way, doctors ~~treat~~ will be treated well ~~good~~ and will not retire. Second, the government should ~~build~~ establish a law ~~to~~ for re-employment. If it is easier to return to the workplace, the number of doctors will increase. However, ~~it is~~ the problem is that ~~they~~ doctors who have not worked for a long time~~, so they~~ can't make a proper diagnosis. To solve this problem, the government should make special exams for ~~a~~ rehiring employees **in rural hospitals**. These two ~~solutions~~ measures will solve the problem of the lack of doctors ~~problem~~ **in rural areas**. |
| Comment sample (142 words) | I also agree that the government should improve the facilities in rural hospitals and increase the pay of doctors there so that more doctors will be willing to keep working there. The content of your paragraph is pretty good, but there are a few errors. The suggestions you gave can be implemented in both rural and urban areas. Note that the question asks specifically about the shortage in rural areas. That’s why it is important to clearly mention “rural hospitals” or “rural areas”. I have added such details to your suggestions. Also, doctors can retire due to old age; the problem is early retirement. Thus, you can write "prevent doctors from retiring early" or “prevent early retirement” to present the idea clearly. I believe you have the potential to write better, so please keep exploring new ideas and enhance your writing skills. |
| **Note:** The cohesion issue in this essay could be addressed through both correction and comment. The other issue pointed out in this comment is a logical issue \- a grammatical correction for “prevent retire” may simply be “prevent retirement” or “prevent from retiring”, but simply that would indicate that doctors will never be allowed to retire. |  |

## Structural Issues

Sometimes, the students don’t follow the proper structure for an essay (*a clear introduction followed by a body and conclusion*) or repeat the introduction in the conclusion. These make the essay structure erroneous; let’s call them “structural issues” or “structural errors” for simplicity.

✅ The conclusion is *not mandatory* for **descriptive essays** (where the students don’t have to justify anything). If a student does write all three parts, that’s great, but if a student skips the conclusion, you don’t have to consider it a structural error.  
✅ All three essay parts are necessary for an **argumentative/opinionative essay** (where the students have to pick a side on a topic and defend/justify their view). Any missing part should be considered a structural error.

[The guide on essay structure](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1MsNe\_M2G335iRek1lihAYc54oi6AaZiieiJl3mi7zwg/edit) elaborates on these. Below are samples for comments.

### Type 1: Lack of a complete introduction-body-conclusion structure 

| Sample 1 Descriptive essay (1) |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Question | What job do you want to do in the future? What are you doing or planning to do for your dream?  |
| Answer sample  *\[missing introduction\]* | **I want to work at an aquarium.** I have watched an anime called White Sand ~~sound~~ Aquatope. It made me interested in working at an aquarium. In order to become an aquarist, I watch YouTube videos. Also, I study about fish and the ocean. |
| Comment sample (116 words) | Working at an aquarium sounds interesting\! I enjoy visiting aquariums, so I appreciate the contribution of the aquarium staff. It’s really amazing that an anime inspired you to choose such a unique job\! To make your career choice easy for the reader to understand, you should introduce it at the beginning of your sentence. That’s why I added an extra sentence to your essay. This is the topic sentence of your essay. In the second-last sentence, “become” needs an object. You could write either “In order to become an aquarist” or “In order to work at an aquarium”.  English can help you study more about the ocean. I hope you study hard and achieve your goal\! |
| Sample 2 Descriptive essay (2) |  |
| Question | People work because they need money to live. Apart from money, what are some other reasons why people work? |
| Answer sample  *\[extreme case\]* | **I believe~~, therefore,~~ that people work for their hobbies.** Another reason why people want to work is ~~for~~ their families. This is because ~~the~~ family is very important. For example, if a person wants to support ~~their~~ his or her family members, such as father, mother, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, and pet, they need to work. ~~They must work for their family.~~ I think, therefore, that people work for their family and hobbies. |
| Comment sample (144 words) *A conclusion was not mandatory, but the corrector added one to show the usage of “therefore” to connect a consequence.* | I agree with you that we work to support our families. Jobs provide opportunities for us to explore opportunities and develop ourselves. This can help us become better people and support our family members. Thus, money is not the only reason. Note that "therefore" is used to describe the result of something. There is nothing before the introduction, so your 1st sentence is not a result. You can use “I believe, therefore, that…” to state a consequence as I showed. The last sentence you wrote was very similar to the 2nd sentence, so I cut it to avoid repetition. By the way, you mentioned that people work for their hobbies too but did not explain it. I suggest you add something about hobbies or not mention it at all. Overall, your ideas are good. Keep practicing, and you will surely improve your writing skills\! |
| Sample 3.1 Opinion/argumentative essay (1) |  |
| Question | Do you agree that high school students should have their own smartphones?  |
| Answer sample  *\[missing conclusion\]* | I agree that high school students should have their own smartphones. First, smartphones have many useful functions. For example, we can use the phone and LINE to contact others, send emails, and play games. Second, ~~It~~ we can quickly find out what ~~you~~ we want to know by using smartphones. For example, ~~you~~ we can watch ~~the~~ lesson videos anytime and any number of times. **For these reasons, it’s good for high school students to have personal smartphones.** |
| Comment sample (138 words) | You have wonderfully described how students can enjoy various functions if they have their own smartphones. Staying in touch with their family is important for safety reasons. I especially like that you explained how they can use their smartphones to study. Please note people can use a smartphone to search for something, but a smartphone cannot search or find something by itself. That’s why, in your 4th sentence, the subject should be “we” or “students”. Also, when you start a sentence with "For example", it should be followed by a full statement, not just a list of things as you wrote in the 3rd sentence. Lastly, it is good to end your essay with a conclusion to emphasize your opinion. That’s why I added a concluding sentence. You have written well. Keep practicing to improve your skills further\! |
| Sample 4 Opinion/argumentative essay (2) |  |
| Question | Do you think that high school students in Japan should go to a foreign country on a school trip? |
| Answer sample  *\[unclear introduction and conclusion\]* | I agree with this idea for the following reasons. First, we, students, can learn about various cultures through school trips. This is beneficial for getting along with foreigners. Second, we can learn how to speak their native languages, such as English and Chinese. People who speak different languages fluently can pronounce any words easily. For these reasons, I agree.  |
| Comment sample (131 words) *The essay was flawless, so detailed suggestions were very important.* | I agree with you that school trips to foreign countries can be very beneficial for students. Learning a foreign language can open up a whole new world of opportunity. Having the chance to speak a foreign language with native speakers can be educational. You have presented your points well, but it would be better to introduce the topic clearly in the first sentence. That way, the reader can understand the topic even without the question. For example, a clearer topic sentence would be, “I agree that Japanese high school students should go abroad on a school trip for the following reasons.” Then, the conclusion can be, “For these reasons, I agree with the idea.” I appreciate the hard work and effort you've put into this writing. Keep up the good work\! |

### Type 2: Similarity between introduction and conclusion

Sometimes the introduction and the conclusion are identical or almost identical. Such similarity is not good because it makes the essay seem repetitive. Teachers are also very particular about this, so we should guide the students when necessary. Details are in the guide on essay structure.

| Sample 1 Grammatically correct introduction and conclusion |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Question | Which do you think is more effective, studying in the morning or at night? |
| Answer sample  | **I think it is more effective to study at night.** First, ~~because~~ my ~~memorial~~ memorization power improves if I study at night. It also makes memorizing subjects easier ~~to remember~~. Second, ~~because~~ I can study for a long time. ~~It~~ Studying at night allows me to study many subjects. **That's why I think it is effective to study at night.** |
| Comment sample (131 words) | I agree with your view on the matter. Studying at night gives us the freedom to take the time we need to understand a subject completely. In the morning, we usually have a lot of things to do, such as having breakfast. I really enjoyed reading your essay. That being said, there are some issues. In the second-last sentence, the meaning of the pronoun “it” was not clear, so I tried to add more details to clarify the meaning. Also, the 1st and the last sentences are almost identical. They are grammatically correct, so I didn’t change them. However, making the last sentence different would improve the quality of your essay a lot. For example, “That’s why I prefer studying at night.” Keep practicing more to improve your writing. Take care. |
| Sample 2 Grammatically incorrect introduction and conclusion |  |
| Question | Which do you prefer, reading the news online or in the newspaper? |
| Answer sample  | **I prefer reading the news online to reading it in a newspaper.** I have two reasons. First, I can read it anytime and I can read it quickly ~~it~~. Second, I can get a lot of information that has been ~~there is a~~ put ~~of~~ on the Internet. **Therefore, ~~I think~~ I prefer reading the news online ~~reading it newspaper~~.** |
| Comment sample (124 words) | You have explained your preference well. Reading the news online indeed has some advantages. It's more convenient as you can access information from anywhere and at any time through devices with Internet connection. It is free too. Note the corrections that have been made. To show preference, we may write “prefer x to y". For example, “I prefer online news to newspapers.” The 1st and the last sentences that you wrote were the same. However, it’s better to have different expressions in the introduction and the conclusion. You could write the last sentence this way too: “Therefore, I think reading the news online is better than reading it in the newspaper.”  This is good work but keep writing more and more to get better\! |

## Logical Issues 

When an essay or any part of an essay has any illogical information or expression, or anything that affects the overall meaning of the essay, it should be considered a logical issue. You should try to **correct it if possible and comment on it**. If correcting the illogical aspect is difficult, you should **at least address it in the comment**. Below are some relevant samples.

| Sample 1 Logical issue: illogical points |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Answer sample  | In order to reduce ~~hte~~ the number of fatal bicycle accidents, I suggest wearing a helmet. Currently, there are very few people wearing helmets, and it is not stipulated by the Japanese ~~now~~ law. Countermeasures~~b~~ include asking everyone to wear ~~a~~ helmets and communicating the benefits of wearing ~~a helmet~~ them. The effect~~s~~ is that wearing a helmet protects ~~your~~ our heads in the event of a collision. ~~In addition~~ As a result, the number of deadly accidents will decrease, and safety awareness will increase. |
| Comment sample (121 words) | Your essay effectively conveys the importance of wearing helmets to reduce fatal injuries caused by bicycle accidents. I also think that safety should always be our priority because we can't predict what will happen. However, note that wearing a helmet reduces the number of fatal accidents, not accidents in general. Making bicycle lanes can be an effective measure for reducing the number of all types of bicycle accidents. You could write, “In order to reduce the number of bicycle accidents, I suggest making dedicated bicycle lanes.” Here, note that when you use a verb after “suggest”, you need to use the gerund (-ing) form: “I suggest making”. I believe you can overcome such errors with practice. Keep up the good work\! |
| Sample 2 Logical issue: insufficient details |  |
| Answer sample  *\[Also included as a sample for structural issues\]* | I believe~~, therefore,~~ that people work **for their hobbies.** Another reason why people want to work is ~~for~~ their families. This is because ~~the~~ family is very important. For example, if a person wants to support ~~their~~ his or her family members, such as father, mother, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, and pet, they need to work. ~~They must work for their family.~~ I think, therefore, that people work for their family and hobbies. |
| Comment sample (144 words)  | I agree with you that we work to support our families. Jobs provide opportunities for us to explore opportunities and develop ourselves. This can help us become better people and support our family members. Thus, money is not the only reason. Note that "therefore" is used to describe the result of something. There is nothing before the introduction, so your 1st sentence is not a result. You can use “I believe, therefore, that…” to start a conclusion as I showed. The last sentence you wrote was very similar to the 2nd sentence, so I cut it to avoid repetition. By the way, you mentioned that people work for their hobbies too but did not explain it. I suggest you add something about hobbies or not mention it at all. Overall, your ideas are good. Keep practicing, and you will surely improve your writing skills\! |
| Sample 3 Logical issue: insufficient details (weak correlation between points) |  |
| Answer sample   | **~~Transportation~~** The living environment is not good in my area. For example, there are unmaintained roads ~~or~~ and vacant houses which might cause accidents. My area has a lot of families, so ~~much~~ such an environment can have a negative effect on them. First of all, I think the government needs to provide subsidies in order to improve the local environment. With subsidies from the government, it would be possible not only to improve roads but also to demolish vacant houses and reuse land. I would ~~like to~~ solve ~~the~~ this problem in my area in this way. |
| Comment sample (138 words)   | Hi there\! A good transportation system is necessary for people living in the area. Government subsidies can indeed solve this problem. It’s good that you also considered the problem of vacant houses. However, note that the transportation system includes roads and vehicles; vacant houses cannot be an example of bad transportation. As you focused on both roads and vacant houses, "the living condition" is a more relevant problem. I added some details to the 2nd sentence to explain how these affect the environment. A clearer topic sentence would be, “If I could solve a problem in my local community, I would solve the problem of the poor living environment.” Also, the second sentence was incomplete; I added verbs and other necessary words to complete it.  I am sure you can write even better essays with practice. Good luck\! |
| Sample 4 Logical issue: weak/irrelevant reasoning & examples |  |
| Answer sample   | I think young people ~~to~~ should be more interested in politics to ensure social initiatives to support older people who will need care in the future. Young people are not ~~o~~ interested in politics these days and do not participate in elections. If young people stopped voting, a member of parliament with biased views might be elected and lead the country or region in the wrong direction, for example, by reducing welfare support for the elderly. Furthermore, I think young people need to communicate with ~~the~~ older people. I think it is important ~~o~~ to understand the behavior of elderly people, check their health, and confirm their ~~survival~~ well-being. |
| Comment sample (133 words)  *\[The essay has an unclear topic sentence (structural issue) as well as insufficient details (logical issue), so both must be prioritized in the comment.\]* | That's a very good paragraph\! Truly, engaging in politics can help young people improve Japanese society in a way to actively support the elderly. You have done a good job of highlighting this point, and I appreciate your efforts. If politicians make biased decisions, Japan might suffer in various ways. To connect the politicians' actions to elderly people needing care, you should add some details about what kind of wrong decisions they might make. Also, the first sentence should introduce the topic clearly, so I added the necessary details. By the way, in the last sentence, "well-being" is more appropriate than "survival". "Well-being" indicates not only the physical survival of elderly individuals but also their overall health, happiness, and quality of life. Nonetheless, you've written well. Keep up the good work\!  |

## Flawless Essays

Flawless essays or almost flawless essays have no or minimal errors, making it difficult to come up with helpful guidance to include in the comments. However, all comments must be helpful for the student, so you should provide suggestions for further improvement. 

Below are some samples for you to get an idea about this.

| Sample 1 Flawless essay (1) |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Answer sample  | Otani Shohei is the best athlete for me. He is one of the most famous baseball players in the world. He has three big achievements. First, he is one of the few Japanese players active in the MLB. Second, he can do well in both pitching and batting. Third, he won the MVP award in MLB last year. These are his big achievements. |
| Comment excerpt: Possible helpful guidance | It is better to use the full form of acronyms like "MLB" (Major League Baseball) and "MVP" (Most Valuable Player) when you first use them in the essay. Doing so will help all the readers understand what they mean. In the last sentence, you can use the word “significant” instead of “big” to avoid repetition.  |
| Sample 2 Flawless essay (2) |  |
| Answer sample  *\[3-sentence essay\]* | I have a bed in my room. I have a desk in my room. I have books in my room. |
|  | The question asked for 3 sentences, but that doesn’t mean only 3 simple sentences. The student could use various sentence structures. |
| Comment excerpt: Possible helpful guidance | You could make your writing a bit more descriptive by using different types of sentences. For example, you could write, “I have a bed in my room. There is also a wooden desk. On top of the desk, there are some books.” This gives a more detailed description of those things. |
| Sample 3 Almost flawless essay (1) |  |
| Answer sample  | Hi, Mary\! Would you like to go to a baseball game on Friday night? I got two tickets for the baseball game. Let's get together in front of my house. I used to play baseball when I was little. So I'm really looking forward to it. It would be fun if we could go together. Bye, Rio |
| Possible helpful guidance | You could first ask Mary if she wants to go or not so that she does not feel obligated to show up if she doesn't want to. For example, you could write, "If you can come, let's meet up in front of my house." |
| Sample 4 Almost flawless essay (2) |  |
| Answer sample  | More paternity leaves are important for making the child-rearing environment in Japan better. The number of women continuing to work after giving birth has been increasing. However, there is a bias that child-rearing is a mother’s task and very few fathers take paternity leaves now. We must be aware that both mothers and fathers should collaborate on child-rearing. Moreover, some fathers say their salary would decrease and their promotion may come late because of taking paternity leaves. Therefore, companies should establish some systems to make taking paternity leaves easy. In conclusion, more fathers taking paternity leaves must be key for more pleasant child-rearing in Japan. |
| Comment excerpt: Possible helpful guidance | Fathers currently don’t want to take paternity leaves for the salary and promotion issues, right? To make that clearer, you could write the 5th sentence this way: “Currently, fathers are reluctant to take paternity leaves because their salaries might decrease and their promotion may be delayed.” |

## Question-Answer Mismatches

There might be cases where the student’s answer doesn’t match the question at all. There can be several reasons for this.

(1) Sometimes students accidentally click on a different question and submit their essay (they often prepare the answer in their notebooks first). In this case, point out the mismatch and briefly suggest double-checking the question before submission.

(2) Some students make the mistake when the topics are similar. You can crosscheck the questions from the [SLC Question Information Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16SsiWP71PcjFGbP5J0kz7757MJVViRupZ2mIFi5b6fk/edit?usp=sharing). In this case, please help the student understand the question with examples to show what the student could write.

(3) Sometimes students simply misunderstand the question. In this case, please help the student understand the question with examples to show what the student could write.

Below are relevant samples.

| Sample 1 Accidental click |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Question | What can Japanese society do to support older people who will need care in the future? |
| Answer sample  | I want to solve the garbage problem. The reason is that we can easily go to the beach and pick up trash. Dirty beaches lead to ocean pollution. It's not good for the environment. Of course, throwing trash into the ocean is not good. It is because some creatures die ~~from~~ because of such garbage. We must ~~scoop~~ clean up the earth for the future. It is important for us to find what we can do now. |
| Comment sample  (110 words)  | Thank you for wonderfully explaining why you want to solve the problem of marine pollution. Protecting marine creatures is important for ecological balance. I enjoyed reading your essay. However, the question here asks what Japanese society can do to support older people who will need care in the future. Kindly remember to double-check the question before submitting the answer in the future. As for grammar, note that we do not start a sentence with "because" to explain something from the previous sentence. We can join it with the previous sentence or start with "It is because". Overall, I appreciate your hard work. Keep practicing, and I wish you good luck\! |
| Sample 2 Topic mix-up |  |
| Question | What traditional Japanese food do you recommend to visitors from abroad? |
| Answer sample  | I ~~i~~ like Japanese food because I ~~i~~ like ~~SYAKE~~ shake (salmon), ~~and MISOSUPU~~ miso soup, and rice. I ~~i~~ don't like bread and eggs because ~~i~~ I like Japanese food. Japanese food is healthy. As I eat Japanese food regularly, my body is ~~Beautiful~~ fit.  |
|  | *The student mistook “What traditional Japanese food do you recommend to visitors from abroad?” for “Do you prefer Western food or Japanese food?”*. |
| Comment sample  (119 words) | It's great that you like Japanese food a lot\! Japanese food has a lot of variety and is very healthy. It is evident from your writing that you are very healthy because you eat Japanese food regularly. You have written about your preference nicely\! However, note that the question asked you to write what traditional Japanese food you would like to recommend to foreigners. It means you have to write about a Japanese dish that you want foreigners to try. For example, you could write, "I recommend foreigners try miso soup.” Also, please remember to always capitalize the pronoun “I”. You have put effort into your writing. I'm sure you'll be able to improve your writing by practicing more.  |
| Sample 3 Misunderstanding |  |
| Question | What is the best season to visit your hometown?  |
| Answer sample  | I like spring best. There are two reasons. First, ~~A~~ a weather that is neither too hot nor too cold is good. The second reason is ~~because~~ that there are ~~so~~ many delicious food~~s~~ items. For these two reasons, I like spring. |
| Comment sample  (122 words)  | I also like spring\! In spring, it is neither too hot nor too cold, and the weather is tolerable and sunny yet not too humid. In my country, spring lasts for a very short time. I understand you like spring, but notice that the question actually asked what is the best season to visit your town. Thus, you should describe what visitors can enjoy if they visit your hometown in spring. For example, you could write what unique food visitors can eat. Also, note that “the second reason is that" is the correct pattern. You can also write, “Second, there are…” Don't lose hope or be afraid. All you need is a little bit of practice. I wish you all the best\! |

Bonus for three-sentence essays (refer to [this correction guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kwcQwuxD5iQy7XMY8qrK5CsMpfWQ0tjIX38oblQc8G4/edit\#heading=h.5vqwgmaw6kdz) too):

1) Explanation sample for 3-sentence essays with **more** than 3 sentences:  
   The question asked you to write 3 sentences, but you wrote   
   *x* sentences. I joined some of your sentences to show you how you could follow the question's instructions and also include all the details.  
     
2) Explanation sample for 3-sentence essays with **fewer** than 3 sentences:  
   The question asked you to write 3 sentences, but you wrote only   
   *x* sentences, so I added *n* more. Please remember to read the question carefully next time.

## Unique Engagement

The students are young, and they sometimes write naughty things. Some students write creative answers that might leave you brainstorming for your comment. In such cases, you can play along with the student to make your comment enjoyable. Below are relevant samples.

| Sample 1  |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Answer sample  | I want to be an emperor. I respect kings of old. It’s because ~~to~~ they governed a country. In addition, ~~to~~ they won ~~a~~ wars. I'm going to start big wars in order to become a king. I ~~make~~ will ensure equality for ~~the~~ everyone in my country ruled by law. |
| Comment sample (131 words) | That's a very ambitious dream\! Being an emperor would be very interesting. This position will come with lots of power and responsibilities. If you start big wars, there will be lots of chances for people to break the law. I think as an emperor, you can ensure equality without wars. If you establish peace and comfort for your citizens, the people of the world will hail you as a great king. The kings of old existed in the past, so their actions are also past events. Because of that, you need to use the past tense when describing them. Also, the things you will do as a king are future possibilities, so you need to use the future tense for that. You have good writing skills. Keep up the good work\! |
| Sample 2  |  |
| Answer sample  | Global warming is getting more and more severe. This is sad. ~~(Sad emoji)~~ One effect global warming has on ~~us~~ Japan is that the lifespan of Samoyed dogs shortens. This is a diabolical disaster. Samoyed dogs are adorable and, frankly, they deserve an everlasting happy life. We need a solution to prolong their lifespan. I've come up with ~~a totally not physically dangerous~~ an easy solution. I am going to politely decline my urge to breathe so I can stop emitting carbon dioxide ~~hydrates~~. In fact, I have put my solution into action in the middle of writing this, and now my mind is not functioning clearly. ~~thinnkk cleaarlyy m,mm my vision it's get tting ddarkker,,uh.~~ |
| Comment sample (136 words) *\[The comment instructs the student to write appropriately without discouraging the student’s creativity\]* | You are absolutely right. It is true that Samoyed dogs are quite adorable and deserve a better fate. However, I would prefer if your solution didn't result in harming yourself. I hope you are breathing again\! Actually, not breathing is physically dangerous, so I changed that part. I think you could focus on explaining how global warming is affecting the health of Samoyed dogs and other animals in Japan, which will affect Japan’s biodiversity. The ending to your essay was full of suspense, but I had to correct it to make it grammatically sensible. I hope you will write in a formal tone *when submitting the essay to your teacher*. *You seem to be good at creative writing. I am actually quite impressed as your essay was very humorous.* I hope you will keep writing more\! |

## Incomplete submission

Some students may not write complete essays because they have little time or little confidence. We need to guide the student to try better next time. Do not express negative remarks about the submission being incomplete.

| Answer sample  | I like dogs better than cats. There are two reasons. First, ~~The~~ dogs usually help humans in many different areas, for example, ~~Hunt~~ hunting ~~The~~ robbers, giving directions to a blind person, and finding lost things ~~Finding Lost and Found~~. Secondly, dogs are cuter than cats. ~~Because~~ Also, dogs are more obedient to people. ~~Secondly, dogs are cuter than cats. Because dogs are more obedient to people.~~ That's all, thank you. ~~and~~ I'm sorry I didn't reach the word limit. ~~a a a a a a a~~ |
| :---- | :---- |
| Comment sample (114 words) | You have nicely expressed your preference with some specific details. I can understand why you like dogs more than cats\! Dogs are known for their friendliness and obedience. I often watch cute dog videos on SNS\! I’m sorry to see that you could not finish your answer for some reason. Hopefully, you can complete it next time\! You could write about your feelings about dogs. For example, “I love playing with dogs because it makes me happy.” The 5th sentence is not a reason for the 4th sentence, so “because” was not suitable. You can use “also” or “moreover” to introduce it as an additional point. I believe you can do better. Keep practicing\! |

## Copy-pasting by Student

If you notice that the student copied from somewhere, you should suggest something different in the comment to make the essay unique. Do not reprimand the student for copying.

| Question | What is your best childhood memory? |
| :---- | :---- |
| Answer sample  | I’ve been working hard so long. It seems like pain has been my only friend. My fragile heart’s ~~it~~ been done so wrong. I wondered if I’d ever heal again. Just like all the seasons never stay the same, all around me, I can feel a change. |
| Comment sample (103 words) | That’s a very clever use of Bruno Mars’s song Today My Life Begins. I must say that I’m impressed\! I wonder if you like the song a lot\! This is a beautiful song for sure. However, it doesn’t quite match the topic. The question asked about your childhood memories, so you could have taken inspiration from a song about memories, such as Yesterday Once More by The Carpenters. Nevertheless, I would suggest using your own words to write about your childhood memories. Listening to English songs is great if you can use them to improve your English skills\! Keep up the good work\! |

## Inappropriate Answer

There can be two types of inappropriate answers:

(1) **Random letters/words:** These are answers that have no sensible content, so there is nothing for you to correct. In this case, you should write an encouraging comment to motivate the student to try better next time. 

(2) **Disturbing content:** When the student expresses something disturbing (i.e., immoral thoughts, criminal tendency, unethical remarks such as racist/sexist views), that content can be considered inappropriate. The comment should still have the necessary components. If possible, you should gently point out the problem with the content.

| Comment sample (112 words) | Hi there\! Self-driving cars have great potential to become the main transportation method in the near future. There are several benefits of these vehicles though there are also some issues related to safety. I believe you wanted to point out that self-driving cars use fuel efficiently, and that the technology to sense the surrounding environment will be critical to the safety of autonomous cars. These are great points\! I hope you will be able to express your ideas clearly next time. Keep practicing and learning, and you’ll be able to write complete essays very soon. Also, don’t be scared of making mistakes. We are here to help you correct them. Best wishes\! |
| Sample 3 Disturbing content (1): criminal tendency |  |
| Answer sample  | My hobby is eating convenience store food without paying. I started this hobby when I was two years old. The first thing I ate without paying was popcorn. I started doing that on the day my teacher got angry. This hobby can save me money, and I can travel to Mongolia and Venezuela with that. What about you? |
| Comment sample (117 words) | A hobby is really important for a person’s mental and physical well-being. It’s great that you have a hobby. I wonder if you also enjoy traveling. A trip to Mongolia or Venezuela would be great. As far as I know, eating convenience store food without paying is stealing. I guess you are joking\! I hope you don’t actually do that as stealing is a bad habit. Anyway, when writing about a past event, you should use the past tense. I have corrected the tense in your 4th sentence. I can see your efforts in your essay. I’m sure you can do better if you practice writing more. We are always here to help you. Best of luck\! |
| Sample 4 Disturbing content (2): profanity |  |
| Answer sample  | My hobby is playing ~~a~~ video games. I have been playing ~~a~~ video games since I was an elementary school student. Recently, a ~~cassette~~ video game called Splatoon 3 was released. I was so excited\! I always call my friends every night. It is so fun that I want to quit ~~the~~ school right now. In this way, I got ~~sick,~~ a video game addiction. ~~Fuck you\!~~ |
| Comment sample (141 words) | It’s great to do things you enjoy, but sometimes one can go too far with a hobby. The good part is that you have realized that you have developed a video game addiction. Giving yourself a strict time limit for daily gaming may help you. Any kind of addiction can be tough to overcome, so don’t be afraid to get help. Coming to your writing, since you mentioned Splatoon 3, which is a video game, you should mention in the topic sentence that your hobby is playing video games. Also, you could use “sick” like this: “In this way, I got sick. I am now addicted to gaming.” I understand that you must be frustrated, but please refrain from using swear words in your academic writing. Keep working hard to improve your health as well as your English skills. Good luck\! |

# Common Mistakes

There are some common mistakes that students and correctors make. Here are some that may appear commonly:

## Word usage: know

To know something means to have knowledge about that ‘something’. Sometimes students write “can know” to mean the acquisition of knowledge. For example, “I can know English better by traveling abroad,” or “In science class, I could know the bad effects of plastic.”

However, “learn” or “get to know”/“come to know” is more suitable to talk about gaining knowledge. For example, “I can learn English better by traveling abroad” and “In science class, I got/came to know about the bad effects of plastic.”

## Word usage: touch/feel

Students sometimes use the verbs “touch” and “feel” when they actually mean “to experience” or “to know about”. This happens because the relevant Japanese word can be used in both cases. You should correct such instances with an appropriate verb depending on the context.

Sample:

| Mistake sample | In Kyoto, you can feel traditional culture. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Correction sample** | In Kyoto, you can learn about traditional culture. |

## Word usage: “local” v/s “rural”

In Japanese, the same word can mean both “rural” and “local”, so students often use “local” when they actually mean “rural”. In English, the adjectives aren’t always interchangeable. A hospital in central Tokyo would be the local/regional hospital for someone living in the neighborhood, but Tokyo is an urban area, so such a hospital is not ‘rural’. That’s why, this usage should be corrected.

Sample:

| Mistake sample | Most local hospitals don’t have advanced medical equipment. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Correction sample** | Most rural hospitals don’t have advanced medical equipment. |

## Word Usage: “mansion”

Japanese people use the word “mansion” to mean big apartment buildings. In English, a mansion is something grand, but the word was adopted into Japanese to mean ‘modern residential buildings’. You might not notice the implication, but the word usage should be checked, and corrected when necessary, just like “ecobag”. Check [this reference](https://jobsinjapan.com/japan-faq/the-difference-between-a-japanese-mansion-and-apartment/) if you want to know more.

Sample:

| Mistake sample | We should make more mansions in the rural area. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Correction sample** | We should make more apartments in the rural area. |
| **Correction sample** | We should make more modern residential buildings in the rural area. |

## Word usage: “drive” for self-driving cars

Self-driving cars are automated and don’t require a human driver. Using “drive” in this case is illogical. There are various types of automation and some cars may have both manual and automation features. However, when describing the features of self-driving cars, students generally describe fully automated cars. In such cases, the logical issue must be resolved. 

| Mistake sample | Correction sample |
| :---: | :---: |
| If you drive a self-driving car, you can relax. | If you ride a self-driving car, you can relax. |
| Even the elderly and disabled people can drive a self-driving car. | Even the elderly and disabled people can use a self-driving car. |
| Drivers can do other things while driving. | People can do other things while traveling. |

*Regarding the samples:* if we do activities related to driving even in a self-driving car, we would have to be attentive, and ‘relaxing’ would not be possible; elderly and disabled people cannot use the manual mode of a self-driving car for the same reason they cannot drive a regular car (possibility of accidents due to their physical and psychological limitations, etc.). 

## Word usage: “drive” for bicycles

The verb “drive” is generally used for vehicles with engines. For bicycles, “**ride**” is suitable: we can ride a bicycle. Similarly, people using bicycles as a transport are called **bicycle riders** rather than bicycle drivers. (Of course, bicyclists and cyclists are also correct.)

## Word usage: “Eco-bags” 

ECOBAGS is a type of reusable bag. Students tend to use it like a common noun, but it should be corrected to “eco-friendly bags” or “reusable bags”.

| Mistake sample | I can use an eco-bag to improve the natural environment. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Correction sample** | I can use an eco-friendly bag to improve the natural environment. |

## Word usage: “smoking people”

Students sometimes write “smoking people” instead of “people who smoke (cigarettes)”. Either “smokers” or “people who smoke” is correct. 

## Verb usage: the missing “should” for suggestions

When sharing suggestions and describing expected future results, students often use the simple present tense without “should”, which gives the impression that the action is already being implemented. However, if the student is to write about suggestions, “should” should be used to indicate which point the suggestion actually is. 

Correctors sometimes misinterpret the use of the simple present tense and think that the action is already being implemented; they then recommend suggesting actions that aren’t already being carried out. However, the verb should actually be corrected.

| Mistake sample | Raising children is very expensive because education costs are high. To help parents, the government provides financial support. This can improve the child-rearing environment in Japan. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Correction sample** | Raising children is very expensive because education costs are high. To help parents, the government should provide financial support. This can improve the child-rearing environment in Japan. |
| **Sample suggestion** | To describe your suggestion, you should use “should”, for example, “should improve”. |

## Verb usage: “improve”

Students sometimes write “improve a problem”. To improve is to make something better. Making a problem better doesn’t express a clear meaning. We can improve the situation, not the problem. We can solve a problem. 

## Article usage: “the”

Grammarly sometimes recommends adding “the” before some proper nouns. However, articles are not generally used with proper nouns other than in certain cases (entities that are a combination like the USA, mountain ranges like the Alps, rivers like the Nile, etc.). Names of some establishments or buildings traditionally take “the” (i.e., the Eiffel Tower), but otherwise, it should not be used with names of places. 

| Mistake sample | Tourists can visit the Kiyomizu Temple in Kyoto. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Correction sample** | Tourists can visit Kiyomizu Temple in Kyoto. |

## Pronoun usage: relative pronouns

The usage of relative pronouns is a much-discussed issue. We previously shared some resources in the group chats. We urge you to go through them again. Here are the links:

1. [When to use which pronoun](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/ja/grammar/british-grammar/relative-pronouns?fbclid=IwAR0Kpy-yJmxbIYrsm7aOAetqsBlO\_Mm7Ednht90\_mMDplb5d3FgzMNTA37g) (please also go through the other resources linked in the blog itself)  
2. [Clauses with relative pronouns](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZPoue8DPfENrsA9jXvqLCuWAP-90q9-M/view?fbclid=IwAR1hsM7JVp0Zx8tQiZNuanMTxY6OcMf4b3WonhlfhHqXKPc6hyGnsydKCg8) (necessary for complex structures)

## Pronoun usage: which v/s that

The usage of these two as relative pronouns in a subordinate clause completely depends *on the meaning*. Remember – 

| Which | Restrictive clauses | non-restrictive clauses |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| That | Restrictive clauses |  |

“which” and “that” can both be used to begin a restrictive clause. However, for non-restrictive clauses, only “which” can be used, not “that”. 

The Grammarly program follows a rule of thumb to simplify the issue: “that” for restrictive clauses and “which” for non-restrictive clauses. If you study the references linked above, you can use your own judgment to avoid unnecessary or wrong corrections.

## Number of Nouns

There have been some reports on corrections related to countable and uncountable nouns, singular and plural forms, etc. Here are some of the frequent errors.

| Some nouns only have one form for both singular and plural forms, such as deer, sheep, and furniture. There are a lot of deer in Nara, not deers\! |
| :---- |
| **Staff** is always plural because it means “employees/personnel”. One person can be a member of staff. There can be a number of staff, few staff, etc. |
| Some nouns have *different forms* depending on the context, such as “**fish**”. This word is often used in global warming/fish catch essays. Remember, “fish” simply indicates the creature and can be both singular and plural. On the other hand, “fishes” is only used to indicate varieties (more than one species). For example,    “Fish eat plastic by mistake and die” “Fishes that cannot live in warm water are migrating to northern parts of the sea.” |
| “**The number of**” can be used with *countable nouns* while “**the amount of**” can be used with *uncountable nouns*. One common scope of mistaking the usage is when using a noun that can be both countable and uncountable depending on the context. Consider these examples – Time “The amount of time spent online” (*duration*)  “The number of times I watched this movie” (*frequency*) Fish “The amount of fish caught this year” (*fish catch is measured in units such as tons*)  “The number of fish living in the ocean” (*though not counted one by one, the number is considered in such cases rather than the amount*) |

## Punctuation Usage

Some common errors occur when correcting certain punctuation marks: comma, semi-colon, and colon. Here are some relevant uses of these marks:

| Comma | Separates words, phrases, and ideas |  |
| :---: | ----- | :---- |
|  | I have been to Cape Soya**,** the northernmost point of Japan. | *The comma is separating an appositive* |
|  | The countryside is peaceful**,** quiet**,** and surrounded by nature. | *The comma is separating items on a list of adjectives* |
| **Semi-colon** | *Can* replace a period between closely related sentences |  |
|  | High-quality goods are durable; they don’t break easily. | *The semicolon is used instead of a period to indicate a close connection between the sentences* |
| **Colon** | Introduces a list or additional explanations for elaboration (phrase or clause) |  |
|  | I think two renewable energies should be made popular in Japan: geothermal energy and solar energy. | *The colon is used to elaborate on 'the two renewable energies'* |

Below are some examples of common errors observed in correctors’ work.

| Mistake Type | Sample | Correct Version |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| A comma before the conjunction in a list of less than 3 items | The countryside is peaceful**,** and quiet. | The countryside is peaceful and quiet. |
| A comma separating the verb from its subject or object | The countryside**,** is peaceful. | The countryside**,** having fewer people than cities**,** is peaceful. |
| Missing comma after introductory phrases and clauses | With practice you’ll get better. | With practice**,** you’ll get better. |
| Missing comma before a coordinating conjunction joining two clauses | You wrote well and with practice, you’ll get better. | You wrote well**,** and with practice, you’ll get better. |

When using a comma between two clauses, one particular error occurs: the comma splice. Using only a comma without any conjunction to join them is wrong. Here are some samples to illustrate the issue along with possible ways to fix the error:

| Wrong | Correct |
| ----- | ----- |
| Cities are convenient, however, there is a lot of noise. | Cities are convenient; however, there is a lot of noise. |
|  | Cities are convenient. However, there is a lot of noise. |
|  | Cities are convenient, but there is a lot of noise. |
| Keep practicing, you will get better. | Keep practicing; you will get better. |
|  | Keep practicing. You will get better. |
|  | Keep practicing, and you will get better. |

*Note:* “however”, “therefore”, “thus”, etc. are adverbs, not conjunctions. When used as linking words, these can show a connection between separate sentences but cannot join two sentences into one single sentence.

## The use of “for example” and relevant phrases

 “such as” and “for example” are used to give examples. These phrases can be used interchangeably when the example is a phrase (i.e., a list of items). However, when the example is written as a complete clause (dependent or independent), only “for example” should be used. 

Acceptable Usage:

* Kyoto has many famous temples**, such as** Kinkakuji and Fushimi Inari Taisha.   
  *\[the examples are only phrases\]*  
* Kyoto has many famous temples**, for example,** Kinkakuji and Fushimi Inari Taisha.  
  *\[the examples are only phrases\]*  
* Kyoto has many famous temples**. For example,** a popular spot is Fushimi Inari Taisha.  
  *\[the example is a complete sentence\]*  
* Convenience stores are helpful for night-shift workers**. For example,** when they need to buy food, they can easily buy it as the stores are open 24 hours.  
  *\[the example is a complete sentence\]*  
* I can use my smartphone to study**, for example,** when I need to look up a word.  
  *\[the example is a subordinate/dependent clause (not a complete sentence)\]*

\* “For example” and “for instance” can be used interchangeably.

### “such as” and commas

When “such as” is used to list examples, it is usually separated with commas. In most cases, the meaning of the sentence remains the same even without the examples. However, when the examples are a crucial part of the meaning, the phrase should be used without commas.

* I need to eat fruits such as oranges and limes to get enough vitamin C.  
  *\[the examples are crucial for the meaning as not all fruits are good sources of vitamin C\]*

* I need to eat citrus fruits, such as oranges and limes, to get enough vitamin C.  
  *\[the examples are not crucial for the meaning as all citrus fruits are good sources of vitamin C\]*

### Examples, and so on

Phrases such as “such as” and “for example” imply that the items mentioned as examples are some out of many. Phrases such as “etc.” and “and so on” mean the same. Thus, using both types of phrases for the same set of examples is redundant. 

Acceptable Usage:

* We should avoid using plastic bags, plastic straws**, and so on**.  
* We should avoid using plastic bags, plastic straws**, etc**.  
* We should avoid using plastic bags, plastic straws**, and other plastic products**.

When is it not redundant?

| Children can enjoy the natural environment in the countryside. For example, they can listen to the sounds of birds, water, wind, and so on. |
| :---- |

In the above sentence, “for example” is being used to introduce an example of what can be enjoyed in the natural environment, and “and so on” is being used for examples of sounds that children can listen to. In such a case, you don’t have to cut any of the phrases. 

## Capitalization: “internet”

“Internet” can be capitalized or not capitalized; either form is acceptable as long as the same form is maintained throughout one piece of text (essay). Thus, if a student writes “internet” throughout the essay, you don’t have to capitalize it, and vice versa. 

## Specific expression: “a lot of nature”

Students often write “a lot of nature” to describe an abundance of nature. English teachers in Japan teach students that “a lot of nature” is incorrect. Thus, we should make necessary corrections. Only writing “there is nature” *(indicating merely the existence of the natural environment)* is also vague and must be corrected. Below are some possible expressions you can use for the correction depending on the context:

| Possible expressions | Example sentences (for your understanding of the usage) |  |
| :---: | ----- | :---- |
| a lot of greenery | The countryside has a lot of greenery. | There is a lot of greenery in the countryside. |
| abundant nature | The countryside has abundant nature. | There is abundant nature in the countryside. |
| scenic landscapes (can be suggested for advanced students) | The countryside has scenic landscapes that can help relieve stress, so we should make these areas more accessible to urban tourists who want a quick break from the hectic city life. |  |

## Specific expression: “move my body”

Students sometimes use this expression (i.e., “I like to move my body”) to explain why they like P.E. or sports activities, but you should correct it to “exercise”, “do some exercise” or “work out”.

## Logical issue: “wearing helmets reduces accidents”

In the essay about bicycle accidents,  some students suggest wearing helmets as a method to reduce the number of bicycle accidents. Wearing helmets might reduce the number of fatal accidents *(in the case of an accident, the risk of fatal injuries will be low if the rider has a helmet on)*; however, it cannot prevent accidents, so simply the act of wearing a helmet cannot reduce the number of accidents. This is a logical issue that must be corrected and addressed in the comment (samples will be added to the comment guide soon).

## Punctuation: quotations

Students sometimes use quotation marks in an attempt to highlight something, but not all things can be quoted in an essay. 

* Quotes, dialogues, and excerpts must be quoted.  
* Titles of artistic works (such as names of books and movies) may or may not be quoted \- they should actually be italicized, but the students cannot use italics on the SLC website.

Anything else should not be quoted. If the student uses quotation marks, you should remove the marks.

Please check the following examples:

✔️When I was in junior high school, I used to fear math, but my teacher taught me kindly and said, “I believe in you.” That inspired me to study math harder.

✔️I watched Your Lie in April.  
✔️I watched “Your Lie in April”.

✔️If I could meet any fictional character, I would choose Hinata Shoyo from Haikyuu.  
❌If I could meet any fictional character, I would choose “Hinata Shoyo” from Haikyuu.

❌”Mt. Fuji” is one of the most famous landmarks in Japan.

# **The How-To of Conjunctions**

| In formal writing (all types of essays), conjunctions should always be used to join two entities within a sentence: a word/phrase with other words/phrases; a clause with other clauses. Coordinating conjunctions (and, but, so, or, etc.) should be used to join clauses or phrases (according to their individual function) and not at the beginning of a simple sentence in formal writing.  Subordinating conjunctions (because, since, whereas, etc.) should be used to join clauses in a complex sentence. They can be either at the beginning or in the middle of the sentence depending on the logical sequence. In informal writing, such as stories, emails, and answers about telling something to classmates or friends, starting a sentence with a coordinating conjunction is acceptable. |
| :---- |

# 

# **Some Commonly Used Conjunctions in Student Writing:**

* Comments should be engaging **and** helpful.

* The correctors are working hard**,** **and** they are careful about not making mistakes. 

* Logical corrections are important**,** **but** unnecessary changes should be avoided.

* Vocabulary errors lead to confusion in meaning**,** **so** they must be corrected. 

* Explanations should be clear **so** every student can understand them. *(so that)*

* All the correctors need to work regularly **because** there are a lot of pending essays.

* **Because** the students are waiting eagerly**,** correctors should ensure timely work.

* **Because** **of** the long holiday**,** many students got SLC homework.

“Because of” is not the same as “because”. “because” can be replaced with “since”, but the same cannot be done to “because of”. Moreover, “because of” can begin a simple sentence whereas “because” cannot.

# **Correcting Conjunction Errors**

In formal writing, the sentences with wrongly used conjunctions can be merged with the adjacent sentences as necessary, or the conjunctions can be replaced with suitable linking phrases.  
Here are some examples:

| Answer Sample | Correction Sample |
| ----- | ----- |
| Practicing every day was hard. But I tried my best and had fun with my friends. | Practicing every day was hard**, b**ut I tried my best and had fun with my friends. |
|  | Practicing every day was hard. ~~But~~ **However,** I tried my best and had fun with my friends. |
| Japanese food is not oily. So it is good for health. | Japanese food is not oily**, s**o it is good for health. |
|  | Japanese food is not oily. ~~So~~ **As a result,** it is good for health. |
| I am for school uniforms. Because I have two reasons. | I am for school uniforms. ~~Because~~ I have two reasons. |
| Summer is the best season to visit my hometown. Because the summer festival is very enjoyable. | Summer is the best season to visit my hometown **b**ecause the summer festival is very enjoyable. |
|  | Summer is the best season to visit my hometown. **This is b**ecause the summer festival is very enjoyable. |
| Quality products are comfortable to use, so they are worth the price. Although not all high-quality goods are too expensive. | Quality products are comfortable to use, so they are worth the price**, a**lthough not all high-quality goods are too expensive. |
|  | Quality products are comfortable to use, so they are worth the price. ~~Although~~ **Nonetheless,** not all high-quality goods are too expensive. |

## **Examples of suitable alternatives for commonly mistaken coordinating conjunctions** 

| And | But | So | Or |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Also/ Moreover/ Additionally/ In addition | However/ In contrast/ On the other hand | Therefore/ As a result/ Thus | Alternatively |

Note: When correcting conjunction errors, the meaning depends greatly on the sequence of the clauses, so correctors should pay attention to the logical flow of each case. Also, some words can be used as different parts of speech, so look up a word if you need to confirm its usage.

# **Commenting on Conjunction Errors:**

### **Coordinating conjunctions used to begin sentences in formal writing:**

| Mistake sample | Tourists can enjoy visiting popular sites. And they can try various traditional Japanese food, such as udon. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Correction sample (1)** *(Changing the conjunction to a conjunctive adverb)* | Tourists can enjoy visiting popular sites. ~~And~~ Also, they can try various traditional Japanese food, such as udon. |
| **Correction sample (2)** *(Joining the sentences using the coordinating conj.)* | Tourists can enjoy visiting popular sites, and they can try various traditional Japanese food, such as udon. |
| **Comment sample**  *(brief)* | Avoid starting a sentence with coordinating conjunctions such as "and" in formal writing. You can start the nth sentence with "Also" or "Moreover".  |
| **Comment sample**  *(detailed)* | Avoid starting a sentence with coordinating conjunctions such as "and" in formal writing. You can start the nth sentence with "Also" or "Moreover".  You can also join the mth and nth sentences using "and". |
| **Note:** the underlined parts should be modified to match the actual mistakes in an essay and corresponding corrections and/or suggestions.  |  |

### 

### **Logical issue due to a wrong conjunction choice:**

A conjunction may not logically fit the context. In this case, you have to correct not only the sentence structures but also the meaning. The sample below illustrates such a case:

| Mistake sample | I want to become better at basketball, but I practice hard. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Note:** “but” is not the correct conjunction as there is no contradiction. Rather, there is a cause-and-effect relation between the desire to become better and practicing hard. |  |
| **Correction sample** | I want to become better at basketball, so ~~but~~ I practice hard. |
| **Comment sample**  | In the nth sentence, the conjunction "but" doesn’t fit because we use "but" to introduce a point that contrasts the previous one. You are practicing hard to become better at basketball. Thus, "so" would be the best conjunction there. |

### **Subordinating conjunctions used with a single clause:**

| Mistake sample | Drones can deliver goods quickly. Because they can fly in the sky. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Correction sample (1)** *(Joining the sentences)* | Drones can deliver goods quickly because they can fly in the sky. |
| **Correction sample (2)** *(Keeping separate sentences)* | Drones can deliver goods quickly. It is because they can fly in the sky. |
|  | Drones can deliver goods quickly. This is because they can fly in the sky. |
| **Comment sample**  | The nth sentence is the reason/cause for the mth sentence, so you need to start the nth sentence with "It is because" or "This is because". Alternatively, you can join both sentences with "because". |

### **Conjunction errors in informal answers:**

There are short answers students write about something to their friends or classmates. You may even encounter questions where students have to write *an email or letter* to a friend. Some questions also ask students to write *a story*. These are considered to be **informal topics**. In such answers, students **can use coordinating conjunctions to begin sentences**. No correction or comment would be required. However, remember to correct any incomplete sentences and/or sentence fragments.

# **The Dilemma of “so”**

“so” as a conjunction cannot be used to begin a sentence. However, it may be a relevant discourse marker. Sometimes, students write **interrogative sentences** in argumentative essays to engage the reader and a discourse marker may be used for that purpose:

| Many people think that climate change cannot be tackled unless every single person cooperates. So, should we wait until everyone cooperates? I believe we should actively try to raise awareness. |
| :---: |
